This is the code repository for [Building Data-Driven Applications with Danfo.js](https://www.packtpub.com/product/building-data-driven-applications-with-danfo-js/9781801070850), published by Packt.

**A practical guide to data analysis and machine learning using JavaScript**

## What is this book about?
Most data analysts use Python and pandas for data processing for the convenience and performance these libraries provide. However, JavaScript developers have always wanted to use machine learning in the browser as well. This book focuses on how Danfo.js brings data processing, analysis, and ML tools to JavaScript developers and how to make the most of this library to build data-driven applications.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Perform data experimentation and analysis with Danfo.js and Dnotebook
* Build machine learning applications using Danfo.js integrated with TensorFlow.js
* Connect Danfo.js with popular database applications to aid data analysis
* Create a no-code data analysis and handling system using internal libraries
* Develop a recommendation system with Danfo.js and TensorFlow.js
