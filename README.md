This is the code repository for [Building Data-Driven Applications with Danfo.js](Packt UTM URL of the Book), published by Packt.

**A practical guide to data analysis and machine learning using JavaScript**

## What is this book about?
Most data analysts use Python and pandas for data processing for the convenience and performance these libraries provide. However, JavaScript developers have always wanted to use machine learning in the browser as well. This book focuses on how Danfo.js brings data processing, analysis, and ML tools to JavaScript developers and how to make the most of this library to build data-driven applications.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Perform data experimentation and analysis with Danfo.js and Dnotebook
* Build machine learning applications using Danfo.js integrated with TensorFlow.js
* Connect Danfo.js with popular database applications to aid data analysis
* Create a no-code data analysis and handling system using internal libraries
* Develop a recommendation system with Danfo.js and TensorFlow.js

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
const df = new DataFrame({...})
df.plot("my_div_id").<chart type>
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data analysts, data scientists, and JavaScript developers who want to create data-driven applications in the JavaScript/Node.js environment. Intermediate-level knowledge of JavaScript programming and data science using pandas is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
